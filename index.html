        </p>
        <p>
          A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive
          structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division
          Angiospermae). The biological function of a flower is to facilitate
          reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm
          with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and
          eggs from different individuals in a population) resulting from
          cross-pollination or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the
          same flower) when self-pollination occurs.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two types of pollination: self-pollination and
          cross-pollination. Self-pollination occurs when the pollen from the
          anther is deposited on the stigma of the same flower, or another
          flower on the same plant. Cross-pollination is when pollen is
          transferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another
          flower on a different individual of the same species. Self-pollination
          happens in flowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same
          time, and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower's
          stigma. This pollination does not require an investment from the plant
          to provide nectar and pollen as food for pollinators.[1] Some flowers
          produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers
          contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many
          flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them
          to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the
          ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds. In addition
          to facilitating the reproduction of flowering plants, flowers have
          long been admired and used by humans to bring beauty to the
          environment, and also as objects of romance, ritual, esotericism,
          witchcraft, religion, holistic medicine, and as a source of food.
